# Test Video App 

> Created 8.23.17 by Seth Watson to test playing video from an embedded iframe using a hosted video streaming service 
  
  I have been testing this to determine viability of using certain video hosting services to create cross-platform web and mobile solutions for an existing web-based video training software product.

## Testing Notes
    
### 8.23.17

  Have only tested on Android 4.1.2 so far. The video player works well in the browser, but fails when the .apk is generated and installed. It also fails when played through the PhoneGap app.
